  spec.description = <<~DESC
    CSV, TSV and any single-byte ASCII separator, and XLSX, ODS and Numbers workbooks, read by a
    native Rust core into typed column batches. The core owns no memory: this gem allocates the buffers once and the
    core fills them in one native call per batch. Every cell is a HyperCast verdict — the
    value, or a reason plus the offending span — and a file that is not rows of cells at
    all is an exception raised after the intact rows. Two backends behind one surface,
    selected automatically and both shipped prebuilt: a Magnus extension where a precompiled
    platform gem matches, and stdlib Fiddle everywhere else. No compile on install.
